# score_4_GUI_AI
The game of Score4 (or Connect 4) in a graphical user interface against an automated minimax player.


The game starts after typing "main()".

Future Goals :

1) implementing bitboards to improve time and search's depth

2) creating a text file called "library" with past positions and the AI's answer, so that every next time we can have immediately the AI's answer.
